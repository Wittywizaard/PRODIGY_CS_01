Hey Peeps!

This is a Cyber Security Project.
Do you know the concepts of encryption and decryption? And how is encryption done?

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique used to secure messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet. As part of my project, I developed a Python program that can both encrypt and decrypt text using this method.

In this project, I coded a small Python program, which converts
PLAINTEXT (which is normally English language) is converted into CIPHERTEXT (which is we can say a coded text) and vice-versa(during decryption). During the process of encryption and decryption. 

As it's a small code, anyone can easily use this code in their project, if they want to do encryption & decryption in their project.
