# PRODIGY_CS_01

Hey Peeps!

This is a Cyber Security Project.
Do you know the concepts of encryption and decryption? And how is encryption done?

During encryption,

  PLAINTEXT (which is normally English language) is converted into CIPHERTEXT (which is we can say a coded text).
     
  and vice-versa(during decryption).

In this project, I coded a small Python program, which converts plaintext into ciphertext and ciphertext into plaintext. During the process of encryption and decryption. As it's a small code, anyone can easily use this code in their project, if they want to do so. And want to do encryption & decryption in their project.
